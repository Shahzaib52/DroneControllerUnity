# Simple Drone Controller Unity

This is a very basic and generic drone controller that can be served as a pretty solid base for many projects. With minimum efforts, it can be used for helicopter and harrier as well.

Highly optimised for mobile devices, it is as real as I wanted it to be but you can expand/modify the codebase however you wish.

In case you need any help understanding the code or anything in general, just shoot me an email at: shahzaib52@hotmail.com, I'll try to get back to you at earliest.

I'd like to thank UltraSuperBox user from BlendSwap Community for sharing his drone model with the community, below is the link to original model:

I had to make some small adjustments to the blend file for the drone model to work with Unity Animations correctly.

Can't wait to see what you can make with it.

Happy Coding.
