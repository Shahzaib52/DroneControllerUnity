# Simple-Drone-Controller

This is a very basic and generic drone controller that can be served as a pretty solid base for many projects. With minimum efforts, it can be used for helicopter and harrier as well.

Highly optimised for mobile devices, it is as real as I wanted it to be but you can expand/modify the codebase however you wish.

In case you need any help understanding the code or anything in general, just shoot me an email at: shahzaib52@hotmail.com, I'll try to get back to you at earliest.

Can't wait to see what you can make with it.
Happy Coding.
